<p> I'm Bruna, a Brazilian Product & Graphic Designer with +5 years of working experience.
    I have been working in the development of physical products for home decor, tech, stationery supplies, and textile articles.
    During my professional journey, I had the pleasure of developing products for amazing brands such as Disney, Warner Bros., Mattel, Nintendo, etc. <p/>

    <p>I also have an international experience studying and living in New York City for one and a half years. I received a fully-funded scholarship in a government program (BSMP) to study both design and English abroad.
    Besides working with physical products, in the last few years, I have developed a special interest in digital products and have focused my studies to user experience design.
     You're welcome to discover more about my work on my social media profiles, and feel free to get in touch if you like it!
